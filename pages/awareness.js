              History of using plant resources for treating diseases can be
              dated back to 6000 to 4000 BCE the Buddhist period. AYM has a vast

              In olden days our ancestors were doing most of the treatments at
              home by different natural ways of taking water/ heat treatment
              etc. with other natural resources available at home with usual
              herbs available in kitchen. Those things had o side effects
              negligible costs and were effective. In recent years increasing
              numbers of people have been choosing herbal medicines or products
              to improve their health conditions either alone or in combination
              with others. Herbs are staging a comeback and herbal “renaissance”
              occurs all over the world. According to the World Health
              Organization 75% of the worlds populations are using herbs for
              basic healthcare needs.

              Basic principals of nature cure are – body heals by itself. Main
              cause of disease is enervation. Deposit of metabolic end-products
              in the body is disease. Acute disease is a remedial process –
              itself a cure. Food is building material does not increase
              vitality. Fasting provides an opportunity to the body to heal
              itself. Exercise or physical activity keeps the balance between
              nutrition and drainage. External treatments whether natural
              allopathic ayurvedic or homeopathy – give only relief do not cure.
              Patients own will to get well determination and faith are
              necessary things for nature cure.

              Ayurveda believes that the entire universe is composed of five
              elements: Vayu (Air) Jala (Water) Aakash (Space or ether) Prithvi
              (Earth) and Teja (Fire). These five elements (referred to as
              Pancha Mahabhoota in Ayurveda) are believed to form the three
              basic humors of human body in varying combinations. They developed
              Ayurveda as a science to balance these elements in our bodies

            <p className="px-2 ">
              The second key principle of Ayurveda and the aspect that sets it
              apart from most medical practices is that Ayurvedas main purpose
              is the maintenance of good health. Ayurvedic medicine does offer
              treatments for health problems but treating disease is a secondary
              function. The primary intention of Ayurvedic practice has always
              been to prevent disease or health problems arising in the first
              place
