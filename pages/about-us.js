                  The Vedas (ancient Hindu Scriptures) state that the human body

                  Majority of People, who have devoted their life in
                  understanding the human body and almighties other creations,
                  admit above. Anatomy of the body is understood by science. But
                  science is still in the process of understanding the exact
                  impact of other factors on body, like good feelings like
                  peace, happiness etc. and bad feelings like lust, wrath,
                  greed, attachment, ego etc.

                  Nature, which provides air and water, is the biggest need of
                  the human body. How the body uses them also has impacts on our
                  body. The breath influences our brain and our mind. Scientists
                  have found that when you breathe through the right nostril,
                  the metabolism in your body is twice as much as when you
                  breathe through the left nostril. When you breathe through
                  your left nostril, it affects the right side of your brain,
                  and when you breathe through the right nostril, it affects the
                  left side of the brain. Breath – It is the most important
                  source of energy. The breath can help us energize our whole
                  system. If you are tired, and you try some breathing
                  exercises, change your breathing pattern, you will feel
                  energetic. A few minutes of meditation energizes your system,
                  bringing your mind to a happy and pleasant state.

            <p className="px-2 py-2 text-base">
              Sadhana refers to the process of mastering (saadh-ne-ko) senses,
              Sadhana is not a particular aspect of life but it’s an act of
              continuous nurturing of both internal and external due to absolute
              devotion towards own will. Human nature needs dynamism, some
              movement in life for betterment within and outside of himself
              without that he feels frustrated. He must keep moving to newer and
              newer possibilities. Sadhana is that which facilitates that.
            </p>
            <p className="px-2 py-2 text-base">
              Every action can be sadhana, if done with absolute will & nature,
              it will promote you towards your enrichment. Sadhana does not mean
              any specific kind of activity such as spiritual ritual, sadhana
              means you are mastering your action as a tool for your wellbeing.

              silence and the practice of bringing the whole person — body,
              mind, soul, imagination, and memory — to prayer. The word
              “sadhana” is a capacious Indian term rich in meanings. It can
              refer to discipline, spiritual practice, and one’s personal means
              for approaching God. De Mello has created 47 exercises drawing on
              Scripture; St. Ignatius, Teresa of Avila, and other mystics;
              modern psychology; and Eastern techniques such as yoga and Zen
              Buddhism.

              awareness in humankind about health, human values and for living a

              If we are sick or have any physical or mental problems, value of
              money diminishes, as you cannot enjoy anything, if you are not
              physically and mentally fit. Value of good health is known only to
              people who are suffering with some ailment. Effort is this website

              There are lot of other sciences, other than the conventional
              allopathic, which are effective and have lesser economic impact on
              individual. What to eat, how to lead a balanced life, exercise,
              yoga, home remedies, ayurveda, acupressure, acupuncture,
              homeopathy and other ancient methods which can assist humankind,
              prior trying allopathy. Effort is being made to collate such
              information in handy and precise manner, so that users can have
              easy access and save their time and money.

              Allopathy is an outcome of lot of research and efforts, which
              should not be avoided, as it is result oriented, but other options
              can be tried prior taking help from allopathy. Trying other things
              will help because allopathy is expensive, it has side effects, it
              helps on one organ and have adverse impact on another organ.
              Moreover, allopathy medicines are generic in nature and effects on
              probabilities, while as almighty has not created every individual
              different from other.
